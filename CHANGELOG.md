## @team-monite/ui-widgets-react@2.0.0 & @team-monite/sdk-api@2.0.0

This is a major release with several breaking changes.
Refer to the [Migration Guide](./MIGRATION.md) for details on how to update your application to use v. 2.0.0 of Monite SDK packages.

### Breaking changes

* `MoniteApp` has been renamed to `MoniteSDK`.
* `MoniteSDK` now accepts the `fetchToken` parameter instead of `token`.
* `MoniteProvider` now accepts an extended `locale` object, whereas `MoniteSDK` no longer uses the `locale` and `currencyLocale` parameters.
* The `ReceivableDetails` component has been renamed to `InvoiceDetails` to indicate that it is used for invoices only.
* The SDK has been updated to use the latest Monite API version, 2023-03-14.

### New features and improvements

* New components for Accounts Receivable: `InvoicesTables` to display outgoing invoices, `QuotesTable` to display quotes, `CreditNotesTable` to display credit notes.
  * The `ReceivablesTable` component has been reworked to use these new components to display the data.

* The `InvoiceDetails` component has been improved to support invoice status transitions:
  * It displays action buttons relevant to the current status of the invoice. For example, "draft" invoices are displayed with the "Issue" and "Delete" buttons.
  * It supports new callbacks that are triggered by status transitions: `onCancel`, `onDelete`, `onIssue`, `onMarkAsUncollectible`.

* By default, the `PayablesTable` component now sorts payables by the creation date (from newest to oldest).

## ui-widgets-react 1.5.0

### New features

* Support for real-time mode in the `PayableDetails` and `PayablesTable` components. These components now automatically refresh the displayed data every few minutes and upon window focus.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed status names in the `PayablesTable` component.
* Fixed some keys in the [localization template file](./packages/ui-widgets-react/src/core/i18n/locales/messages.pot).

## ui-widgets-react 1.4.0

### New features

* Support for customizing and localizing UI labels in components.

## ui-widgets-react 1.3.0

### Breaking changes

* In the `<CounterpartDetails>` component, the default value of the `showBankAccounts` prop was changed from `false`
  to `true`.

### New features

* You can now change the currency locale used by Monite UI Widgets. To do this, use the new `currencyLocale` prop of the
  root `<MoniteApp>` component. The prop accepts a [BCP 47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) language
  identifier, such as "en-US". The default value is "de-DE".

  Usage example:

  ```js
  const monite = new MoniteApp({
    apiUrl: 'https://api.sandbox.monite.com/v1',
    entityId: 'ENTITY_ID',
    token: 'ACCESS_TOKEN',
    currencyLocale: 'en-US'
  });
  ```

## ui-widgets-react 1.2.4

### Breaking changes

* Previously, clicking the Pay button in the `<PayablesTable>` and `<PayableDetails>` components would automatically
  send a request to the Monite API to mark the invoice as paid. This automatic API call was removed.

  However, you can use the `onPay` callback to perform the desired actions when the users click Pay. For example, you
  can explicitly call the "mark as paid" API from the callback function.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed errors when clicking Save in the `<PayableDetails>` component.

## ui-widgets-react 1.2.3

* Internal changes to support future enhancements.

## ui-widgets-react 1.2.2

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue where the `<CounterpartsTable>` component did not display the last name and contact information of
  counterparts of type=individual.
* Fixed an issue where the Save button in the `<PayableDetails>` component also triggered the Submit action if the form
  was previously filled out with errors.

## ui-widgets-react 1.2.1

### Removed functionality

* Column sorting was removed from the `<PayablesTable>` component.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue where new counterparts could not be created.
* Fixed displaying of counterpart addresses.

## ui-widgets-react 1.2.0

### New features

* The `<PayableDetails>` component has a new `optionalFields` prop that controls whether to display or hide some
  optional fields in payable details, specifically: "Invoice date", "Suggested payment date", "Tags", "IBAN", and "BIC".
  By default, these fields are displayed. Usage example:

  ```
  <PayableDetails
    id="9df6c614-f25f-4b2f-807c-f1e2c919019c"
    ...
    optionalFields={{
      invoiceDate: true,
      suggestedPaymentDate: true,
      tags: false,
      iban: false,
      bic: false
    }}
  />
  ```

### Improvements

* The `<PayableDetails>` component demo in the Storybook was reworked to better illustrate the entire payable lifecycle
  flow starting from the `draft` status until `paid`/`canceled`.

* Monite SDK is now built using Node.js v. 18.14.0 instead of v. 16.14.2.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue where currencies other than Euro did not work properly in payable components.

* Fixed an issue with applying filters in the `<ApprovalPoliciesTable>` component after pagination.

* Fixed a display issue with the `<PaymentDetails>` component in the Storybook.

## ui-widgets-react 1.1.0

### New features

* The `<CounterpartDetails>` component has a new `showBankAccounts` prop that controls whether to display the "Bank
  accounts" section.

### Bug fixes
